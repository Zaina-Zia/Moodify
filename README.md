# Moodify

Discover music that feels like you, access the project <a href= "https://moodify-tau-five.vercel.app/"> here </a>

Moodify transforms how you explore songs by generating playlists that match your current mood and listening taste. Instead of generic recommendations, the app crafts emotionally aligned soundscapes — whether you’re relaxed, energized, melancholic, or somewhere in between.

It’s not just another playlist generator — it’s a dynamic listening companion that understands your vibe.

## Core Features

### Mood-Based Playlists
Select your current mood, and Moodify curates songs that capture its tone — energetic beats for “Happy,” calm instrumentals for “Chill,” or soft acoustics for “Sad.” Each playlist is uniquely generated to reflect your emotional state.

### Personalized Suggestions
Your top tracks and past preferences influence every recommendation. The more you interact with Moodify, the better it understands your taste, producing playlists that balance familiarity with discovery.

### Smart Search
Easily search for tracks, artists, or genres to refine your mood playlist. The search blends your input with your selected mood, so results stay relevant and consistent with your current atmosphere.

### Intuitive Interface
The interface is minimal and fluid — focusing attention on the music rather than clutter. Cards display each track’s title, artist, and cover, with a built-in preview button for quick listening.

### Real-Time Refresh
Playlists dynamically update based on your chosen mood or refined preferences, ensuring every session feels personalized and alive.

### Mood Selector
A simple, clean control at the top of the app lets you toggle between moods. Each selection instantly reshapes the playlist below, visually shifting to match the mood’s tone through subtle UI color changes.

### Responsive Design
Moodify is built for all devices, adapting fluidly from desktop to mobile for a consistent experience anywhere you listen.

## Visual and User Experience
